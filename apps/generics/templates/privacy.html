              <p><strong>Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong></p>

              <p>The technologies we use for automatic data collection may include: <strong>[</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong> A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to the Site.&nbsp;</p>

              <p><strong>Flash Cookies.</strong> Certain features of the Site may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on the Site. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.</p>

              <p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Pages of the Site and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit Loom, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). &nbsp;</p>

              <p><strong>Do Not Track Policy</strong></p>

              <p>Your web browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. We do not honor any web browser “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms that provide you with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.&nbsp;</p>

              <p><strong>Third-party Responsibilities and Services.&nbsp;</strong></p>

              <p>We may use or partner with other third party companies, agents or contractors for various purposes in connection with our business and operations (“<strong>Service Providers</strong>”), including, billing and payments, relationship building, the marketing and growth of our business and the performance of services on our behalf, such as gathering and analyzing information and the provision of services to you.&nbsp; In the course of performing these responsibilities and providing such services, these other companies may have access to your information.&nbsp; We may also share information, including your information, with these Services Providers in order to enable them to perform these responsibilities and to provide these services.&nbsp; Many Services Providers have adopted their own privacy policies, which are not subject to control by Loom. You should always review the policies of these Service Providers to make sure that you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect, use, maintain, protect and disclose your information.</p>

              <p>The Service Providers may also transmit cookies to your computer or device, when you click on ads that appear on or through the Service. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you are no longer using any our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your web browser.</p>

              <p><strong>Use of Remarketing with Google Analytics and Google Adwords and other Remarking Services</strong></p>

              <p>The Site may use the Google AdWords and other remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to the Site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on the Site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Service Providers, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Site. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with this privacy policy, Google’s privacy policy or the privacy policy of other remarketing services used by Loom.</p>

              <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">Google Ad Preferences page</a>, and if you want to, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie&nbsp; settings</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/plugin?hl=en">permanently using a browser plugin</a>.</p>

              <p><em>DoubleClick: We may use Google Analytics remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages or take specific actions on a website. This allows us to provide targeted advertising in the future. If you do not wish to receive this type of advertising from us in the future you can opt out using the </em><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/plugin?hl=en"><em>DoubleClick opt-out page</em></a><em> or the </em><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"><em>Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</em></a><em>.</em></p>

              <p>We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information.&nbsp; However, despite our efforts, no security controls are 100% effective and Loom cannot ensure or warrant the security of your personal information. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. &nbsp;</p>

              <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to and use of certain parts of the site, the Development Services and/or the other Loom Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of any of the Loom Services. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any Company, Contractor or other user of the Site.</p>

              <p>It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated on the home pages of the Site for at least 30 days. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information that are materially less protective than provided in this policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you by e-mail to the e-mail address specified in your account and/or through a notice on the home pages of the Site and to attempt to get your consent to the changes. The date the privacy policy was last updated is identified above. You are responsible for ensuring that we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you, and for periodically visiting the Site and this privacy policy to check for any changes.&nbsp; Like our Terms, of which this privacy policy is a part, your use, and/or continued use after our efforts to contact you, of the Site, the Development Services or any of the other Loom Services, means that you agree to be bound by such&nbsp;changes.</p>

              <p><strong>Survival</strong></p>

              <p>The policies indicated in this privacy policy will remain effective, even if the Terms and the other agreements between us are terminated and you are no longer using the Site, the Development Services or any of the other Loom Services.</p>
