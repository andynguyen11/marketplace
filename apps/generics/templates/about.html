              <h1 class="text-brand brand-bold text-center">Loom is a platform
              that weaves together ideas, equity and code.</h1>
              <h3 class="brand text-center">We enthusiastically connect
              passionate visionaries with talented developers to bring digital
              products to life.</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>In addition to equity compensation, Loom also supports cash
              compensation for work.</p>
              <p>With an emphasis on building quality digital products in
              exchange for equity, freelancers on Loom can display their
              technical proficiencies,
              allowing entrepreneurs to easily find the talent they need. Loom
              also includes all necessary legal contract templates to engage a
              qualified freelancer, which are then auto-generated and signed
              electronically directly through the platform.</p>
              <p>Our goal with Loom is to create a platform that empowers
              anyone to actualize their ideas into powerful products without
              the need for raising venture funding. We believe that some of the
              world’s best ideas are trapped in the minds of non-technical
              people. And now, Loom is here to help bring those ideas to life
              by connecting entrepreneurs directly with technical freelancers
              willing to work for cash or equity.</p>
              <p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of web
              developers is projected to grow 27 percent from 2014 to 2024,
              much faster than the average for all occupations. And more
              generally, there are about 15 million freelance workers in the
              US. That number is expected to grow to over 60 million by
              2020.</p>
              <p>With such high demand for a work-for-equity platform, all
              freelancers on Loom are rated and reviewed using integrated
              functionality to ensure quality. Entrepreneurs are also
              encouraged to chat with freelancers through the platform and see
              their work history to further qualify them for a given
              project.</p>
              <p>Posting a project on Loom is free for entrepreneurs, after
              which the freelance community can bid on the project in equity or
              cash offers. As the project’s manager, entrepreneurs can filter
              all of their bids by equity offer, cash offer, quality or
              location, then hire any developer of their choosing to complete
              the project for a small engagement fee. Once a bid is accepted,
              all industry-standard legal contracts are auto-generated and
              electronically delivered to both parties to commence the
              project.</p>
              <p>On Loom, we charge the hiring party a fee of $3-per-hour of
              the estimated work to engage any developer on a project. As it is
              free to post projects on Loom and receive bids from developers
              around the world, companies only pay a fee if they receive a bid
              they like and choose to engage a freelancer on their project.</p>
              <p>Our goal is to never charge fees to contractors on Loom.</p>
              <p>We’re proud to have you as a contributor to the first
              work-for-equity platform. Our goal is to connect the brightest,
              passionate minds together for mutual interest in bringing some of
              the world’s best ideas to life.</p>
              <p>Loom is proudly based in Austin, Texas.</p>
