              <ul>
                  <li>
                      Employers shall make any and all payments in connection with the Loom
                      Services, including for any Services performed by any Contractor that
                      they met through any of the Loom Services, exclusively through the Loom
                      payment platform, whether or not the Services were listed on the Loom
                      Services or not.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Contractors shall invoice and receive any and all payments in
                      connection with the Loom Services, including for any Services performed
                      for any Employer that they met through any of the Loom Services,
                      exclusively through the Loom payment platform, whether or not the
                      Services were listed on the Loom Services or not.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Loom charges a fee to post any Services. The posting fee will vary
                      depending on the length that an Employer wishes to keep its Services
                      posted. This posting fee shall be refunded upon payment of an aggregate
                      of at least $200 to the Contractor for such Services within six (6)
                      months of engaging such Contractor.

                  <li>
                      Loom charges service fees for all Services and any future Services
                      (whether or not the Services were listed on the Loom Services)
                      performed by a Contractor engaged by an Employer that it met through
                      any of the Loom Services comprised of (a) ten percent (10%) of all cash
                      payments made by an Employer (even if part of the compensation is paid
                      as equity) and (b) $500 when the compensation for any Services is to
                      paid exclusively as equity. The cash fee shall be deducted from any
                      payments made by an Employer to a Contractor. The equity fee shall be
              paid by the Employer at the commencement of the Services.        <strong> </strong>

                      If an Employer or Contractor wishes to avoid having to pay the Loom
                      services fees and working through the Loom payment and invoicing
                      platforms, it may pay Loom an opt-out fee of $3000.

                      any the Loom Services for a full-time employment position, then the
                      Employer shall pay Loom a placement fee equal to ten percent (10%) of
                      the Contractor's aggregate first-year salary.

              </p>
              <p>
                  Loom offers an independent platform through which Employers can post
                  Services (the “<strong>Posted Services</strong>”) that they need and can
                  connect and engage Contractors to perform such Posted Services. An Employer
                  shall provide the details and specifications of the work in commercially
                  reasonable detail in connection with the Posted Services (collectively, the
                  “<strong>Services Details</strong>”), including the deliverables, the
              estimated time to complete the Posted Services (the “    <strong>Estimated Development Time</strong>”), the milestones, the payment
                  schedule, the specifications, the project completion date and such other
                  information as an Employer considers relevant. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, the Posted Services and the Services Details may not include any
                  information that would, directly or indirectly, identify the Employer,
                  including its name or the name of any employee, address or any telephone
                  number or email address. Services include all future Services performed by
                  a Contractor for an Employer if the Employer and Contractor met through any
                  of the Loom Services even if the services are not listed on the Loom
                  Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                  All Services Details shall be provided by an Employer in good faith based
                  on reasonable commercial assumptions and practices. The Services Details
                  will generally be included on the Site. In certain circumstances, however,
                  an Employer may consider some or all of the Services Detail to be
                  confidential (the “<strong>Confidential Services Details</strong>”). In
                  that case, a Contractor will only be able to view the Confidential Services
                  Details by agreeing to Loom’s required terms of confidentiality.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Employers must submit all proposed Services to Loom for approval prior to
                  posting such Services. Loom reserves the right (a) to review all proposed
                  Services for quality and compliance, (b) to reject any proposed Services
                  that do not meet Loom’s requirements and guidelines, including any proposed
                  Services that Loom deems to be sub-par or questionable and (c) to modify
                  the proposed Services for clean-up (e.g., typos, etc.) and compliance with
                  these Terms. Loom shall use commercially reasonable efforts to review all
                  proposed Services as soon as possible and generally within one (1) business
                  day of submission. You will have a reasonable opportunity to address any
                  issues that Loom may have. The decision by Loom regarding any proposed
                  Services, including whether to approve, modify or reject any such Proposed
                  Services, shall be final.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Employers shall select how long (e.g., 15 days, 30 days, etc.) they wish to
              have their proposed Services posted on the Loom Services (the “    <strong>Posting Period</strong>”). The Posted Services shall automatically
                  be removed from posting after the Posting Period unless (a) the Employer
              has elected to implement auto-renewal for additional Posting Periods (“    <strong>Auto-renewal</strong>”) or (b) otherwise agreed by Loom. Once
                  implemented, Auto-renewal shall continue from Posting Period to Posting
                  Period until the Employer has terminated Auto-renewal prior to the end of
                  the then current Auto-renewal Posting Period.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Contractors can then submit a proposal to perform the Posted Services,
                  including the applicable fees that such Contractor requires in order to
                  perform the Posted Services (the “<strong>Services Proposal</strong>”).
                  Such fees can be in the form of equity in the Employer (e.g., 1%, 2%, stock
              options, etc. (the “<strong>Equity Fee</strong>”)) or cash (the “<strong>Cash Fee</strong>” and collectively with the Equity Fee, the “    <strong>Services Fees</strong>”) or a combination of cash and equity. With
                  respect to any Equity Fee, (a) the Employer and Contractor shall agree on
                  all of the applicable terms (e.g., the grant date, the delivery date and
                  process, etc.) and (b) Employer shall provide all information reasonably
                  requested by Contractor (e.g., the fair market value, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Employer then has the option to accept, reject or negotiate the
                  Services Proposal.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Until the Employer has responded to a Service Proposal, (a) no information
                  that would, directly or indirectly, identify the Employer (e.g., its name
                  or the name of any employee, address or any telephone number or email
                  address) may be disclosed and (b) the only information that may be
                  disclosed about a Contractor, is location, experience, work examples and
                  referrals and such other information allowed by Loom in its sole
                  discretion. <strong> </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                  To post Services and to engage a Contractor, an Employer must (a) set-up an
                  account with Loom and (b) provide a valid credit card that can be used to
                  make payments due in connection with the Loom Services, including the
              Services Fees (as changed from time to time, the “    <strong>Credit Card</strong>”). You may change the Credit Card that you
                  want to be used in connection with the Loom Services but Loom must always
                  have a valid Credit Card available for the payment of all amounts due under
                  these Terms, including the Services Fees. By agreeing to these Terms, you
                  authorize Loom to charge the Credit Card for all such amounts due in
                  connection with the Loom Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                  To submit a Service Proposal and perform the Services, and to view any
                  Confidential Services Details, a Contractor (a) must set-up an account with
              Loom and (b) provide a valid bank account (the “    <strong>Bank Account</strong>”) in which a Contractor will receive payment.
                  Loom will then verify the Bank Account to ensure that the Contractor can
                  receive payment. It may take up to three (3) business days to verify your
                  Bank Account. During that period, the Contractor may submit a Service
                  Proposal but it will not be sent to the Employer until the Bank Account has
                  been verified. Once your Bank Account has been verified, you will not need
                  to provide the Bank Account information as long as the Bank Account is
                  still valid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Contractor does not need to
                  set-up an account or provide a bank account to see any Services Details
                  that are publicly available on the Site.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Contractor shall provide the Services to Employer on a non-exclusive basis
                  and shall be free to bid on other Posted Services and provide its services
                  to third parties during the term of any Development Agreement; provided
                  however that Contractor shall not provide such services to third parties in
                  such a way that is inconsistent with any provisions hereof or the
              applicable Development Agreement (as defined in    <strong>Section 4.3</strong>), or that so occupy the Contractor’s time and
                  efforts as to impair or diminish the quality, professionalism or first
                  priority performance of the Services provided to Employer under the
                  applicable Development Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                  If you engage a Contractor, or are engaged by an Employer, to perform any
              Services, you shall promptly notify loom at    <a href="mailto:support@loom.co">support@loom.co</a> no later than five (5)
                  business days prior to the commencement of the performance of the Services
                  under that engagement.

              </p>
              <p>
                  After an Employer has responded to a Service Proposal, the Contractor and
                  the Employer may freely communicate with each other without restriction,
                  either through the Site or off-line.

                  .
              </p>
              <p>
                  (a) Loom strongly encourages Employers and Contractors to memorialize the
                  terms and conditions of an accepted Services Proposal and the Services to
                  be performed in a legally binding agreement, including the agreed-upon
                  compensation, ownership of intellectual property developed and other key
                  terms (a “<strong>Development Agreement</strong>”). The more complete the
                  Development Agreement is, the less likely there will be surprises and
                  disputes regarding expectations. The Development Agreement should be signed
                  before a Contractor commences work on any Services. A Development Agreement
                  is strictly between the relevant Employer and Contractor and Loom shall
                  have no obligations, responsibilities or liabilities in connection with a
                  Development Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                  (b) Loom provides a form of Development Agreement (as modified from time to
                  time, “<strong>Loom Development Agreement</strong>”) at no charge that you
                  are welcome to use as a sample in connection with an accepted Services
                  Proposal and the Services. You may modify the Loom Development Agreement
                  without restriction as agreed by the parties. Although Loom believes that
                  the Loom Development Agreement is generally consistent with industry
                  practices, you should always seek legal advice before signing legal
                  documents of any kind, including the Loom Development Agreement. Loom is
                  providing the Loom Development “as is” and without warranties of any kind
                  and your use of the Loom Development Agreement is solely at your risk.

                  .
              </p>
              <p>
                  (a)<strong> Posting Fees</strong>. Loom charges Employers a fee to post any
                  Services (a “<strong>Posting Fee</strong>”). The amount of the Posting Fee
                  will vary depending on the Posting Period. The current Posting Fees for the
              various Posting Periods can be found at    <a href="https://www.loom.co/how/">https://www.loom.co/how/</a> . This
                  Posting Fee shall (i) not be charged until the proposed Services have been
                  approved by Loom and posted and (ii) be refunded upon the payment by the
                  Employer of an aggregate of at least $200 to the Contractor for such
              Services within six (6) months of engaging such Contractor (the “    <strong>Payment Window</strong>”); provided that the Posting Fee may be
                  retained by Loom and shall not be refunded to an Employer if such Employer
                  has not made such minimum payment of $200 to the Contractor prior to the
                  end of the Payment Window.
              </p>
              <p>
                  If an Employer has elected to implement Auto-renewal, Loom charges such
                  Employer an additional Posting Fee for each Auto-renewal Posting Period for
                  the applicable Posted Services. The additional Posting Fees are
                  automatically charged on the first (1<sup>st</sup>) business day of each
                  Auto-renewal Posting Period. The additional Posting Fees associated with
                  Auto-renewal are not refundable. .
              </p>
              <p>
                  (b)<strong> Loom Service Fees</strong>.

                  the Cash Fees paid by the Employers for all Services (as modified from time
                  to time, the “<strong>Loom Cash Fee</strong>”). The Loom Cash Fee shall be
                  deducted by Loom from the Cash Fees prior to depositing payment into a
                  Contractor’s Bank Account. The Loom Cash Fee includes any processing fees
                  payable to the Payment Processor for the payment services. The Loom Cash
                  Fee does not include (a) any fees associated with cross-border transactions
                  or foreign exchange services, (b) any fees charged by your local bank, (c)
                  taxes due in connection with the Services Fees or (d) any penalties or
                  fines imposed on you or the Payment Processor by any bank, money services
                  business, payment network, or other financial intermediary resulting from
                  your use of the payment services in a manner not permitted by these Terms
              or any applicable rules and regulations (the “    <strong>Additional Contractor Amounts</strong>”). A Contractor is solely
                  responsible for any Additional Contractor Amounts. Loom or the Payment
                  Processor may, without prior notice, withhold any Additional Contractor
                  Amounts<strong> </strong>from any amounts due to Contractor.

                  Services are to paid exclusively as equity (as modified from time to time,
                  the “<strong>Loom Equity Fee</strong>” and together with the Loom Cash Fee,
                  the “<strong>Loom Services Fees</strong>”). The Loom Equity Fee shall be
                  paid by the Employer no later than the day on which Contractors begins to
                  provide the Services.<strong> </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                  (c) <strong>Opt-out Fee</strong>. If you wish to avoid (i) having to pay
                  the Loom Services Fees or (ii) working through the Loom payment and
                  invoicing platform, you may pay Loom an opt-out fee of $3000 (as modified
                  from time to time, the “<strong>Opt-out</strong> <strong>Fee</strong>”). If
                  you want to pay the Opt-out Fee, you shall notify Loom at support@loom.co
                  The Opt-out Fee may be paid at any time but any Loom Services Fees paid or
                  invoiced before the payment of the Opt-out Fee shall not be affected by the
                  Opt-out Fee. The Opt-out Fee shall only apply to a specific Employer and a
                  specific Contractor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even after the Opt-out
                  Fee has paid, if an Employer hires that Contractor for a full-time
                  position, the Employer must still pay the Placement Fee in accordance with
                  Section 4.4 (d).
              </p>
              <p>
                  (d)<strong> Placement Fee</strong>. If you wish to hire a Contractor that
                  you met through the Loom Services for a full-time employment position, then
                  you shall pay Loom a placement fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the
                  Contractor's aggregate first-year salary (as modified from time to time,
              the “<strong>Placement Fee</strong>”). You shall notify Loom at    <a href="mailto:support@loom.co">support@loom.co</a> of any such hire no
                  later than ten (10) days after the Contractor has accepted your offer. The
                  Placement Fee is due no later than the Contractor's start date.
              </p>
              <p>
                  (e)<strong> Circumvention Fee</strong>. If (i) an you encourage or solicit
                  complete or partial payment of any amounts due in connection with the Loom
                  Services, including any Services Fees, outside of the Loom Services or (ii)
                  you engage a Contractor that you met through any of the Loom Services to
                  perform any Services (even if not listed on the Loom Services) outside of
                  the Loom Services, then you shall pay a circumvention fee equal to the
                  greater of (x) $3000 and (y) ten percent (10%) of all fees paid or payable
              to the Contractor plus $3000 (as modified from time to time, the “    <strong>Circumvention Fee</strong>”). The Circumvention Fee is due no later
                  than ten (10) days after notice from Loom. If you in good faith believe
                  that the Circumvention Fee should not be due and payable, you shall contact
                  Loom at <a href="mailto:support@loom.com">support@loom.co</a> to resolve
                  any dispute. The decision by Loom regarding any Circumvention Fee shall be
                  final.
                  <strong>
                      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Circumvention Fee is held to be
                      unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, you shall be obligated
                      to pay the maximum Circumvention Fee permitted by law.
                  </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              (f) <strong>Modification to the Fees</strong>. Subject to    <strong>Section 9</strong>, Loom may modify the Posting Fees, the Loom
                  Services Fees, the Opt-out Fee, the Placement Fee, the Circumvention Fee
                  and any other fees in connection with any of the Loom Services (as modified
                  from time to time, collectively, the “<strong>Fees</strong>”) in its sole
                  discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
                  (g) <strong>Taxes</strong>. To the extent that any sales or other similar
                  taxes are payable by Loom, or any Payment Processor in connection with the
                  Services or the Development Agreement, Employer shall be obligated to pay
                  to Loom, or any such Payment Processor the amount of such taxes in addition
                  to any other amounts owing to Loom.
              </p>
              <p>
                  (h) <strong>Future Services</strong>. In paying any of the Services Fees or

              </p>
              <p>
                  (a) <strong>Exclusivity</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  (i) Employers shall make any and all payments for any Services performed by
                  any Contractors that they met through any of the Loom Services, exclusively
                  through the Loom payment platform, whether or not the Services were listed

              promptly notify Loom at    <a href="mailto:support@loom.com">support@loom.co</a> if you become aware
                  that any User is violating or attempting to violate any of the terms of

              </p>
              <p>
                  (b) <strong>Invoices</strong>. Contractors should invoice the Employers on
                  a regular basis (e.g., weekly, monthly, etc.). This will ensure that
                  Contractors are paid promptly and that any concerns or issues regarding any
                  invoices can be resolved promptly.
              </p>

                  writing and Loom at support@loom.co of the situation (with a reasonably
                  detail explanation of the issue), if you fail to pay any Services Fees or
                  Loom Equity Fees by the applicable due date, including by cancelling your
              Credit Card, initiating an improper chargeback, or any other means (a “    <strong>Payment Failure</strong>”), Loom shall have the right, without
                  prior notice, to charge your Credit Card for the full amount of the
                  Services Fees and/or any applicable Loom Equity Fees.

                  use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you prior to any such
                  suspension or termination; provided that any failure you to notify you
                  shall not affect Loom’s right to suspend or terminate. You shall not engage

                  the Site or otherwise through the Loom Services. If Loom updates these
                  Terms, it will update the “last updated” date at the top of the Terms.
                  Please check these Terms, including any Policies, periodically for changes.
                  Your continued use of the Services after the posting of changes constitutes
                  your binding acceptance of such changes. In the event that a change to
                  these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations (including
                  applicable Fees), Loom will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such
                  change. Loom may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within any of
                  the Loom Services, by sending an email to any address you may have used to
                  register for an account, or through other similar mechanisms. Additionally,
                  if the changed Terms materially modify your rights or obligations, Loom may
                  require you to provide consent by accepting the changed Terms. If Loom
                  requires your acceptance of the changed Terms, changes are effective only
                  after your acceptance. For all other changes, except as stated elsewhere by
                  Loom, such amended Terms or fees will automatically be effective, replacing
                  the previously-effective Terms or fees, thirty (30) days after they are
                  initially posted on any of the Loom Services.
