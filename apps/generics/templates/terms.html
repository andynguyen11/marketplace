          <p><strong>Loom Terms of Service</strong></p>

          <p>Last updated: August 8, 2016</p>

          <p>Welcome to<strong> Loom</strong>. Loom<strong> </strong>is an independent platform through which companies (“<strong>Companies</strong>”) can connect and engage independent contractors (“<strong>Contractors</strong>”) for web development and other services (the “<strong>Development Services</strong>”). The website at www.joinloom.com (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and the various other related services, features, functions, software, applications, websites and networks (together with the Site, collectively, the “<strong>Loom Services</strong>”) are provided and operated, and are being made available to you, your organization (the “<strong>Organization</strong>”), Contractors, Companies and the other users of any of the Loom Services (collectively, “<strong>Users</strong>”) by Loom Labs, Inc.<strong> </strong>(“<strong>Loom</strong>”). All defined terms used herein shall have the meanings prescribed to these terms in these Terms of Service.</p>

THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS”) GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND THE OTHER LOOM SERVICES.&nbsp; BY CLICKING “I AGREE”, DOWNLOADING, USING, CONFIGURING OR ACCESSING THE SITE OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOOM SERVICES OR THE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE SIGNIFYING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT (A) YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO ENTER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR AND ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND YOUR ORGANIZATION, AND ARE DOING SO, (B) YOU AND YOUR ORGANIZATION CAN LEGALLY ENTER INTO THESE TERMS AND (C) YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU, THE ORGANIZATION AND EACH USER SHALL BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND LOOM’S PRIVACY POLICY (HTTP://JOINLOOM.COM/PRIVACY/) (THE “PRIVACY POLICY”) AND ALL MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS PROVIDED FOR. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE LOOM SERVICES.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>1. Eligibility.&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>To access and use the Site and the other Loom Services and the Development Services, you must be at least 18 years of age. By engaging any Contractor, by posting or bidding on any Development Services or performing or receiving any Development Services, clicking the “I Agree” button or by downloading, installing or otherwise accessing or using any of the Loom Services, you represent that:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>You satisfy the eligibility requirements and have not been previously suspended or removed from the Site or any of the other Loom Services or prohibited from accessing and using the Development Services;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>You confirm that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Loom; and</p>

          <p>You will comply with these terms and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>2. Privacy.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Your privacy is important to Loom. Our goal is to make the Loom Services as good, useful and rewarding for you as possible. In order to do that, Loom may collect and process information from you when you use any of the Loom Services, post or bid on any Development Services or perform or receive any Development Services. Loom will collect certain personally identifiable information from you as set forth in more detail in our Privacy Policy. By accessing and using any of the Development Services, engaging any Contractor, posting or bidding on any Development Services or performing and receiving any Development Services, you agree that Loom may collect, use and disclose, as set forth in the Privacy Policy, the information you provide during your access to or use of any of the Loom Services, and in some cases information that is provided by or through any of the Loom Services, the engagement of any Contractor, the posting of or bidding on any Development Services&nbsp; or the receipt or performance of any Development Services by other parties.</p>

          <p><strong>3. License Grant; Unauthorized Use.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>3.1 LICENSE GRANT</strong></p>

          <p>Subject to your compliance with all the terms and conditions set out in these Terms, Loom hereby grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, freely revocable license to access and use the Site and the other Loom Services and the Development Services to the extent and in accordance with these Terms.</p>

          <p><strong>3.2 PREVENTION OF UNAUTHORIZED USE</strong></p>

          <p>Loom reserves the right to exercise whatever lawful means it deems necessary to prevent unauthorized use of any of the Loom Services and the Development Services, including, but not limited to, technological barriers, IP mapping, and directly contacting your Internet Development Service Provider (ISP) regarding such unauthorized use.</p>

          <p><strong>4. Development Services; Fees.</strong></p>

          <p>Loom offers an independent platform through which Companies can post Development Services (the “<strong>Posted Development Services</strong>”) that they need and can connect and engage Contractors to perform such Posted Development Services.&nbsp; Company shall provide the details and specifications of the work in commercially reasonable detail in connection with the Posted Development Services (collectively, the “<strong>Proposed Services Details</strong>”), including the deliverables, the estimated time to complete the Posted Development Services (the “<strong>Estimated Development Time</strong>”), the milestones, the payment schedule, the specifications, the project completion date and such other information as a Company considers relevant &nbsp;</p>

          <p>All Services Details shall be provided by a Company in good faith based on reasonable commercial assumptions and practices. The Services Details will generally be included on the Site. In certain circumstances, however, a Company may consider some or all of the Services Detail to be confidential (the “<strong>Confidential Services Details</strong>”).&nbsp; In that case, a Contractor will only be able to view the Confidential Services Details by agreeing to Loom’s required terms of confidentiality.</p>

          <p>Contractors can then bid to perform the Posted Development Services, including the applicable fees that such Contractor requires in order to perform the Posted Development Services (the “<strong>Services Bid</strong>”).&nbsp; Such fees can be in the form of equity in the Company (e.g., 1%, 2%, stock options, etc. (“<strong>Equity</strong>”)) or cash (collectively, the “<strong>Services Fees</strong>”) or a combination of cash and Equity.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>To post Development Services and to engage a Contractor, a Company must set-up an account with Loom. To bid on and perform the Development Services, and to view any Confidential Services Details, a Contractor must set-up an account with Loom. A Contractor does not need to set-up an account to see any Services Details that are publicly available on the Site.</p>

          <p>A Company and a Contractor can negotiate the Services Fees and the following Proposed Services Details (the “<strong>Negotiable Terms</strong>”):</p>

          <p>the Scope of Services</p>

          <p>the specific Deliverables</p>

          <p>the milestones</p>

          <p>the completion date for the Posted Development Services</p>

          <p>the specifications for the Services and the Deliverables</p>

          <p>the Payment Schedule (in accordance with the options described below)</p>

          <p>If a Company accepts a Services Bid, or a Company and a Contractor otherwise reach agreement on the Services Fees and the Negotiable Terms and Contractor has accepted the other Services Details (collectively, the “<strong>Accepted Services Details</strong>”), then such Company and such Contractor shall enter into Loom’s standard development agreement (as modified from time to time, the “<strong>Development Agreement</strong>”) and hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms and effective as of the date accepted in writing by both parties (the “<strong>Effective Date</strong>”). The Services Fees and any agreed Negotiable Terms will be incorporated into the Development Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the parties may not modify the Development Agreement without the prior written approval of Loom, which approval shall be in Loom’s sole discretion.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A party may only terminate a Development Agreement upon a material breach of such Development Agreement by the other party which is not cured within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such breach is provided by the non-breaching party. Company may also terminate a Development Agreement immediately upon written notice (i)&nbsp;upon a breach by Contractor of any terms of confidentiality under Section&nbsp;6.1 of the Development Agreement; or (ii)&nbsp;if Contractor engages in gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud. To the extent that there is a conflict between the provisions of these Terms and the provisions of the Development Agreement, the provisions of these Terms will control.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;Any Services Fees shall either be (A) paid and/or granted and vest fifty percent (50%) upon execution of this Agreement and fifty percent (50%) within thirty&nbsp;(30) days following completion and acceptance of the Posted Development Services in accordance with these Terms and the terms of the Development Agreement (“<strong><em>Acceptance</em></strong>”) or (b) paid and/or granted and vest fifty percent (50%) upon completion of the Half-way Milestone (as defined below) as determined in the reasonable judgment of Company and fifty percent (50%) upon Acceptance. If the Services Fees are in the form of Equity, Company shall take all action necessary to have the Equity granted and issued in accordance with its stockplan and all applicable securities and other laws. If payment is based on the “Half-way Milestone”, then the milestones provided as part of the Proposed Services Details shall, at a minimum, include the milestone(s) that represent or otherwise reflect the half-way point for completion of the Posted Development Services (the “<strong>Half-way Milestone</strong>”). &nbsp;</p>

          <p>Concurrent with execution of the Development Agreement, Company shall pay a fee to Loom for providing the Loom Services based on an hourly rate set by Loom in its sole discretion (as modified from time to time, the “<strong>Hourly Rate</strong>”) multiplied by the Estimated Development Time (the “<strong>Estimated Loom Fee</strong>”). If the actual time to complete the Posted Development Services (the “<strong>Actual Development Time</strong>”) is greater than the Estimated Development Time, then the Estimated Loom Fee shall be trued-up to reflect the Actual Development Time and Company shall pay to Loom no later than ten (10) days after completion of the Posted Development Services the difference between (a) the Estimated Loom Fee and (b) the amount resulting from multiplying the Hourly Rate by the Actual Development Time (such difference, the “<strong>True-up Payment</strong>”). Loom reserves the right to modify any such Hourly Rate upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice posted in advance on the Site. Any such increase shall apply in connection with any Development Services posted after such thirty (30) period.&nbsp; The current Hourly Rate can be found at joinloom.com/how-it-works. The Estimated Loom Fees and any True-up Payment shall be paid through a third party payment processor (e.g., Stripe, etc.) (any such third party payment processor, the “<strong>Third Party Processor</strong>”) or such other payment processor as directed by Loom. If Company fails to pay the applicable Estimated Loom Fee for any reason, then the Development Agreement shall automatically be terminated and Company agrees that it will not engage Contractor in connection with development or other services, and Contractor agrees that it will not perform any development or other services to Company, for a period of two (2) years from the termination date of the Development Agreement.</p>

          <p>Contractor shall provide the Development Services to Company on a non-exclusive basis and shall be free to bid on other Posted Development Services and provide its services to third parties during the term of any Development Agreement; provided however that the Contractor shall not provide such services to third parties in such a way that is inconsistent with any provisions hereof or the Development Agreement, or that so occupy the Contractor’s time and efforts as to impair or diminish the quality, professionalism or first priority performance of the Development Services provided to Company under the Development Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Company and Contractor shall be solely responsible for resolving any dispute regarding the Development Agreement or any Posted Development Services, including the performance of the Posted Development Services, the Services Fees or the Services Details, and Loom shall have no responsibility or liability regarding any such dispute.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>To the extent that any sales or other similar taxes are payable by Loom, or any Third Party Processor in connection with the Posted Development Services or the Development Agreement, Company shall be obligated to pay to Loom, or any such Third Party Processor the amount of such taxes in addition to any other amounts owing to Loom.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

          <p>In paying the Estimated Loom Fees and any True-up Payment, Company acknowledges and agrees that it is not relying on future availability of any Development Services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>ALL FEES, INCLUDING ANY ESTIMATED LOOM FEES, TRUE-UP PAYMENTS AND SERVICES FEES, ARE NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-CANCELLABLE AND NON-CREDITABLE UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW.&nbsp;</p>

Your continued use of the Development Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.

Loom may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within any of the Loom Services, by sending an email to any address you may have used to register for an account, or through other similar mechanisms. Additionally, if the changed Terms materially modify your rights or obligations, Loom may require you to provide consent by accepting the changed Terms. If Loom requires your acceptance of the changed Terms, changes are effective only after your acceptance. For all other changes, except as stated elsewhere by Loom, such amended Terms or fees will automatically be effective, replacing the previously-effective Terms or fees, thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on any of the Loom Services.&nbsp; <strong>IF AT ANY TIME YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE YOUR USE OF ALL LOOM SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT SERICES.</strong></p>

          <p>To the extent that any modifications to the Terms or Policies are not allowed under applicable laws, the prior most recent version of the Terms or Policies shall continue to apply.</p>
