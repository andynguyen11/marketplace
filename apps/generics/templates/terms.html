              </ol>
              <p><strong>4.1 DEVELOPMENT SERVICES</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loom offers an independent platform through which Companies can post Development Services (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Posted Development Services</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) that they need and can connect and engage Contractors to perform such Posted Development Services.&nbsp; Company shall provide the details and specifications of the work in commercially reasonable detail in connection with the Posted Development Services (collectively, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Proposed Services Details</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;), including the deliverables, the estimated time to complete the Posted Development Services (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Estimated Development Time</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;), the milestones, the payment schedule, the specifications, the project completion date and such other information as a Company considers relevant &nbsp;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Services Details shall be provided by a Company in good faith based on reasonable commercial assumptions and practices. The Services Details will generally be included on the Site. In certain circumstances, however, a Company may consider some or all of the Services Detail to be confidential (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Confidential Services Details</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;).&nbsp; In that case, a Contractor will only be able to view the Confidential Services Details by agreeing to Loom&rsquo;s required terms of confidentiality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractors can then bid to perform the Posted Development Services, including the applicable fees that such Contractor requires in order to perform the Posted Development Services (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Services Bid</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;).&nbsp; Such fees can be in the form of equity in the Company (e.g., 1%, 2%, stock options, etc. (&ldquo;</span><strong>Equity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;)) or cash (collectively, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Services Fees</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) or a combination of cash and Equity.&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the Connection Fee (as defined in </span><strong>Section 4.5</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">) has been paid, the only information that can be disclosed about (a) a Company, is its name and the first name of the person responsible for hiring and such other information allowed by Loom in its sole discretion and (b) a Contractor, is location, experience, work examples and referrals and such other information allowed by Loom in its sole discretion. In addition, subject to </span><strong>Section 4.2</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, neither Company nor Contractor shall disclose any personally identifying information (&ldquo;</span><strong>Identifying Information</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;), including, last names, phone numbers, email addresses, social handles, external links, Skype handles and any other information that Loom decides could be used to identify and communicate off-line with the individuals involved. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To post Development Services and to engage a Contractor, a Company must set-up an account with Loom. To bid on and perform the Development Services, and to view any Confidential Services Details, a Contractor must set-up an account with Loom. A Contractor does not need to set-up an account to see any Services Details that are publicly available on the Site.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractor shall provide the Development Services to Company on a non-exclusive basis and shall be free to bid on other Posted Development Services and provide its services to third parties during the term of any Development Agreement; provided however that Contractor shall not provide such services to third parties in such a way that is inconsistent with any provisions hereof or the applicable Development Agreement (as defined in </span><strong>Section 4.3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">), or that so occupy the Contractor&rsquo;s time and efforts as to impair or diminish the quality, professionalism or first priority performance of the Development Services provided to Company under the applicable Development Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p><strong>4.2 &nbsp;COMMUNICATIONS</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until a Company has paid the Connection Fee (as defined in </span><strong>Section 4.5(a)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">), (a) all communications between a Company and a Contractor shall be through Loom&rsquo;s messaging system and shall not include any Identifying Information and (b) a Company and a Contractor shall each be limited to five (5) &ldquo;free&rdquo; messages to the other. There will be a message counter that will indicate how many free messages you have left. Once a Company or a Contractor has used its five free messages, then Company shall be required to pay the Connection Fee in order for the party (whether Company or Contractor) that has exhausted its free messages to continue communicating with the other party. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The messaging system may automatically block any communication that includes any Identifying Information.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a Company wants to connect with a Contractor, or a Contractor wants to connect with a Company, a party shall send a connection request through Loom&rsquo;s messaging system to the other party. If the other party approves the connection request, then the Company shall be obligated to pay the Connection Fee in accordance with </span><strong>Section 4.5(a)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the Connection Fee has been paid, Company and Contractor shall be free to continue to communicate through Loom&rsquo;s messaging system and there shall be no restriction on sharing Identifying Information or on the number of messages. </span></p>
              <p><strong>4.3 &nbsp;NEGOTIABLE TERMS</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) &nbsp;</span><strong>Loom Development Agreement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Loom limits the terms that can be negotiated to simplify the process and to minimize the extensive negotiations and time often involved in finalizing a development agreement. Accordingly, if a Company and a Contractor decide to use the Loom Development Agreement (as defined as defined in </span><strong>Section 4.4(a)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Company and Contractor can only negotiate the Services Fees and the following Proposed Services Details (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Loom Negotiable Terms</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;):</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Scope of Services</span></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the specific Deliverables</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the milestones</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the completion date for the Posted Development Services</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the specifications for the Services and the Deliverables</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the payment terms (in accordance with the options described in </span><strong>Section 4.4(b)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (b) &nbsp;</span><strong>Alternative Development Agreement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If a Company and a Contractor decide to use an Alternative Development Agreement (as defined in </span><strong>Section 4.4(a)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">), the parties are free to negotiate the Services Fees, any of the Proposed Services Details and any of the other terms and conditions in the Alternative Development Agreement (together with the Loom Negotiable Terms, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Negotiable Terms</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;).</span></p>
              <p><strong>4.4 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a)</span> <strong>Development Agreement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If a Company accepts a Services Bid, or a Company and a Contractor otherwise reach agreement on the Services Fees and the Negotiable Terms and Contractor has accepted the other Services Details (collectively, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Accepted Services Details</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;), the parties shall enter into a development agreement that reflects such Accepted Services Details. &nbsp;The parties may elect to use Loom&rsquo;s standard development agreement (as modified from time to time, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Loom Development Agreement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) or any other form of development agreement that is mutually acceptable to the parties (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Alternative Development Agreement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; and together with the Loom Development Agreement, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Development Agreement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms and conditions of the applicable Development Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms and effective as of the date accepted in writing by both parties (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Effective Date</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). To the extent that there is any conflict between the terms and conditions of a Development Agreement and these Terms, these Terms shall apply.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company and Contractor shall be solely responsible for resolving any dispute regarding any Development Agreement or any Posted Development Services, including the performance of the Posted Development Services, the Services Fees and the Services Details, and Loom shall have no responsibility or liability regarding any such dispute.&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b)</span> <strong>Loom Development Agreement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &nbsp;Loom offers the Loom Development Agreement to facilitate the process between a Company and a Contractor. If Company wishes to use the Loom Development Agreement, Company shall pay the Agreement Fee in accordance with </span><strong>Section 4.5(c)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Services Fees and any agreed Negotiable Terms will be incorporated into the Loom Development Agreement. Except as set forth in </span><strong>Section 4.3(a)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the parties may not modify the terms of the Loom Development Agreement without the prior written approval of Loom, which approval shall be in Loom&rsquo;s sole discretion.&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A party may only terminate a Loom Development Agreement upon a material breach of such Loom Development Agreement by the other party which is not cured within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such breach is provided by the non-breaching party. A Company may also terminate a Loom Development Agreement immediately upon written notice (i)&nbsp;upon a breach by Contractor of any terms of confidentiality under </span><strong>Section&nbsp;6.1</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Loom Development Agreement; or (ii)&nbsp;if Contractor engages in gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Any Services Fees shall either be (A) paid and/or granted and vest fifty percent (50%) upon execution of the Loom Development Agreement and fifty percent (50%) within thirty&nbsp;(30) days following completion and acceptance of the Posted Development Services in accordance with these Terms and the terms of the Loom Development Agreement (&ldquo;</span><strong>Acceptance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) or (b) paid and/or granted and vest fifty percent (50%) upon completion of the Half-way Milestone (as defined below) as determined in the reasonable judgment of Company and fifty percent (50%) upon Acceptance. If the Services Fees are in the form of Equity, Company shall take all action necessary to have the Equity granted and issued in accordance with its stockplan (or its equivalent) and all applicable securities and other laws. If payment is based on the &ldquo;Half-way Milestone&rdquo;, then the milestones provided as part of the Proposed Services Details shall, at a minimum, include the milestone(s) that represent or otherwise reflect the half-way point for completion of the Posted Development Services (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Half-way Milestone</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). &nbsp;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative Development Agreements. If the parties elect to use an Alternative Development Agreement, the Services Fees and any agreed Negotiable Terms will be incorporated into the Alternative Development Agreement. The parties may modify the Alternative Development Agreement as mutually agreed in accordance with </span><strong>Section 4.3(b)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;Company and Contractor shall promptly send to Loom a copy of any accepted or executed Alternative Development Agreement.</span></p>
              <p><strong>4.5 &nbsp;FEES</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a)</span> <strong>Connection Fees</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For a Company and a Contractor to connect directly with each other, including gaining access to any Personally Identifiable Information, a Company shall pay a connection fee (as modified from time to time, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Connection Fee</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). The current Connection Fee can be found at </span><a href="https://healthmedocs/hmtfees.html/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">loom.co/how/.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Connection Fee shall be due and payable whether or not Company actually engages any such Contractor to provide any Development Services. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b)</span> <strong>Circumvention Fee</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If Company fails to pay the Connection Fee and Loom reasonably determines that Company has engaged any Contractor that Company has contacted through any of the Loom Services, Company shall pay a circumvention fee of $3000 (as modified from time to time, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Circumvention Fee</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Company in good faith believes that the Circumvention Fee should not be due and payable, Company shall contact Loom at </span><a href="mailto:support@loom.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@loom.co</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to resolve any dispute. The decision by Loom regarding any Circumvention Fee shall be final. </span><strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Circumvention Fee is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, Company shall be obligated to pay the maximum Circumvention Fee permitted by law. </strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(c)</span> <strong>Agreement Fees</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &nbsp;If Company wishes to use the Loom Development Agreement, Company shall pay an agreement fee (as modified from time to time, the &ldquo;</span><strong>Agreement Fee</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;).
