            <p><b>3.1 LICENSE GRANT</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subject to your compliance with all of the terms and conditions set out in these Terms, Loom hereby grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, freely revocable license to access and use the Site and the other Loom Services and the Services to the extent and in accordance with these Terms.</span></p>
            <p><b>3.2 PREVENTION OF UNAUTHORIZED USE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loom reserves the right to exercise whatever lawful means it deems necessary to prevent unauthorized use of any of the Loom Services and the Services, including, but not limited to, technological barriers, IP mapping, and directly contacting your Internet Service Provider (ISP) regarding such unauthorized use.</span></p>
            <p><b>4 Services; Communications; Development Agreements; Loom Fees; Payment and Payment Processing.</b></p>
            <p><b>4.1 SERVICES</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loom offers an independent platform through which Employers can post Services (the “</span><b>Posted Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) that they need and can connect and engage Contractors to perform such Posted Services.&nbsp; An Employer shall provide the details and specifications of the work in commercially reasonable detail in connection with the Posted Services (collectively, the “</span><b>Services Details</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), including the deliverables, the estimated time to complete the Posted Services (the “</span><b>Estimated Development Time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), the milestones, the payment schedule, the specifications, the project completion date and such other information as an Employer considers relevant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Posted Services and the Services Details may not include any information that would, directly or indirectly, identify the Employer, including its name or the name of any employee, address or any telephone number or email address. Services include all future Services performed by a Contractor for an Employer if the Employer and Contractor met through any of the Loom Services even if the services are not listed on the Loom Services.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Services Details shall be provided by an Employer in good faith based on reasonable commercial assumptions and practices. The Services Details will generally be included on the Site. In certain circumstances, however, an Employer may consider some or all of the Services Detail to be confidential (the “</span><b>Confidential Services Details</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”).&nbsp; In that case, a Contractor will only be able to view the Confidential Services Details by agreeing to Loom’s required terms of confidentiality.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers must submit all proposed Services to Loom for approval prior to posting such Services. Loom reserves the right (a) to review all proposed Services for quality and compliance, (b) to reject any proposed Services that do not meet Loom’s requirements and guidelines, including any proposed Services that Loom deems to be sub-par or questionable and (c) to modify the proposed Services for clean-up (e.g., typos, etc.) and compliance with these Terms. Loom shall use commercially reasonable efforts to review all proposed Services as soon as possible and generally within one (1) business day of submission. You will have a reasonable opportunity to address any issues that Loom may have. The decision by Loom regarding any proposed Services, including whether to approve, modify or reject any such Proposed Services, shall be final.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers shall select (a) the type of posting (e.g., for a full-time or freelance position) and (b) the feature package (e.g., free, basic or premium) (collectively, the “</span><b>Package</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). The different Packages will vary based on the duration of the posting period (the “</span><b>Posting Period</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) and the various features included in the Package (e.g., featured project, dedicated support, etc.). &nbsp;An Employer can switch to any other Package at the end of the then current Posting Period. The Posted Services shall automatically be removed from posting (or relegated to an inactive state) after the Posting Period </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unless</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a) the Employer has elected to implement auto-elects to renewal for a Package and for an additional Posting Periods (a “</span><b>Auto-rRenewal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) or (b) otherwise agreed by Loom. Once implemented, Auto-rA Renewal will not happen automatically and an Employer must affirmatively elect to renew at the end of each Posting Period. &nbsp;shall continue from Posting Period to Posting Period until the Employer has terminated Auto-renewal prior to the end of the then current Posting Period. </span><b>[Note to Loom: Can an employer switch programs in the middle of a posting period? If so, how would that work?]</b></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AN EMPLOYER THAT HAS SELECTED THE “FREE” PACKAGE MUST UPGRADE TO THE BASIC OR PREMIUM PACKAGE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO A SERVICES PROPOSAL. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractors can then submit a proposal to perform the Posted Services, including the applicable fees that such Contractor requires in order to perform the Posted Services (the “</span><b>Services Proposal</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”).&nbsp; Such fees can be in the form of equity in the Employer (e.g., 1%, 2%, stock options, etc. (the “</span><b>Equity Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”)) or cash (the “</span><b>Cash Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and collectively with the Equity Fee, the “</span><b>Services Fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) or a combination of cash and equity.&nbsp;With respect to any Equity Fee, (a) the Employer and Contractor shall agree on all of the applicable terms (e.g., the grant date, the delivery date and process, etc.) and (b) Employer shall provide all information reasonably requested by Contractor (e.g., the fair market value, etc.). </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Employer then has the option to accept, reject or negotiate the Services Proposal. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the Employer has responded to a Service Proposal, (a) no information that would, directly or indirectly, identify the Employer (e.g., its name or the name of any employee, address or any telephone number or email address) may be disclosed and (b) the only information that may be disclosed about a Contractor, is location, experience, work examples and referrals and such other information allowed by Loom in its sole discretion. </span><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To post Services and to engage a Contractor, an Employer must (a) set-up an account with Loom and (b) provide a valid credit card that can be used to make payments due in connection with the Loom Services, including the Services Fees (as changed from time to time, the “</span><b>Credit Card</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). You may change the Credit Card that you want to be used in connection with the Loom Services but Loom must always have a valid Credit Card available for the payment of all amounts due under these Terms, including the Services Fees. By agreeing to these Terms, you authorize Loom to charge the Credit Card for all such amounts due in connection with the Loom Services.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To submit a Service Proposal and perform the Services, and to view any Confidential Services Details, a Contractor must set-up an account with Loom. In addition, if a Contractor has, or can set-up, a bank account or an approved payment system in any of the Qualifying Countries (an “</span><b>Eligible Contractor</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), then, on or prior to the date when the Eligible Contractor intends to send its first invoice, it must provide a valid bank account or approved payment system in a qualified country (collectively, a “</span><b>Qualified Payment System</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) in which a Contractor will receive payment. Loom will then verify the Qualified Payment System to ensure that the Contractor can receive payment through such Qualified Payment System. It may take up to three (3) business days to verify your Qualified Payment System and during that period, the Contractor may not be able to receive any payments. Once your Qualified Payment System has been verified, you will not need to provide the Payment System information as long as the Qualified Payment System is still valid. A non-Eligible Contractor that does not have, or cannot set-up, a Qualified Payment System, should agree in advance with the Employer on how payments are going to be made. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Contractor does not need to set-up an account to see any Services Details that are publicly available on the Site. The current list of qualifying countries and approved payment systems can be found at </span><a href="https://www.loom.co/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.loom.co/about/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractor shall provide the Services to Employer on a non-exclusive basis and shall be free to bid on other Posted Services and provide its services to third parties during the term of any Development Agreement; provided however that Contractor shall not provide such services to third parties in such a way that is inconsistent with any provisions hereof or the applicable Development Agreement (as defined in </span><b>Section 4.3</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), or that so occupy the Contractor’s time and efforts as to impair or diminish the quality, professionalism or first priority performance of the Services provided to Employer under the applicable Development Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you engage a Contractor, or are engaged by an Employer, to perform any Services, you shall promptly notify loom at </span><a href="mailto:support@loom.co"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@loom.co</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no later than five (5) business days prior to the commencement of the performance of the Services under that engagement. </span></p>
            <p><b>4.2 &nbsp;COMMUNICATIONS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an Employer has responded to a Service Proposal, the Contractor and the Employer may freely communicate with each other without restriction, either through the Site or off-line.</span></p>
            <p><b>4.3 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) Loom strongly encourages Employers and Contractors to memorialize the terms and conditions of an accepted Services Proposal and the Services to be performed in a legally binding agreement, including the agreed-upon compensation, ownership of intellectual property developed and other key terms (a “</span><b>Development Agreement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). The more complete the Development Agreement is, the less likely there will be surprises and disputes regarding expectations. The Development Agreement should be signed before a Contractor commences work on any Services. A Development Agreement is strictly between the relevant Employer and Contractor and Loom shall have no obligations, responsibilities or liabilities in connection with a Development Agreement.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) Loom provides a form of Development Agreement (as modified from time to time, “</span><b>Loom Development Agreement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) at no charge that you are welcome to use as a sample in connection with an accepted Services Proposal and the Services. You may modify the Loom Development Agreement without restriction as agreed by the parties. Although Loom believes that the Loom Development Agreement is generally consistent with industry practices, you should always seek legal advice before signing legal documents of any kind, including the Loom Development Agreement. Loom is providing the Loom Development “as is” and without warranties of any kind and your use of the Loom Development Agreement is solely at your risk.</span></p>
            <p><b>4.4 LOOM FEES</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a)</span><b> Posting Fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Loom charges Employers a fee to post any Services (a “</span><b>Posting Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). The amount of the Posting Fee will vary depending on the type of posting and the &nbsp;Package selected by an Employer. The current Posting Fees for the various Packages can be found at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.loom.co/project/pricing/</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This initial Posting Fee shall not be charged until the proposed Services have been approved by Loom and posted. &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an Employer has elects to renew a Package for an additional Posting Period ed to implement Auto-renewal, then Loom shall charges such Employer an additional Posting Fee for each Auto-renewal such Package for the applicable Posted Services. The additional Posting Fees will be charged on the first (1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) business day of the start of the Posting Period of each Auto-rRenewal. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b)</span><b> Loom Service Fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Loom charges the Contractors a service fee of ten percent of (10%) of the Cash Fees paid by the Employers for all Services (as modified from time to time, the “</span><b>Loom Services Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). The Loom Services Fee for (i) an Eligible Contractor shall be deducted by Loom from the Services Fees prior to depositing payment into such Contractor’s Qualifying Payment System and (ii) a non-Eligible Contractor shall be paid directly to Loom by the applicable Employer at the same time that Employer pays such non-Eligible Contractor. The Loom Services Fee includes any processing fees payable to the Payment Processor for the payment services. The Loom Services Fee does not include (a) any fees associated with cross-border transactions or foreign exchange services, (b) any fees charged by your local bank, (c) taxes due in connection with the Services Fees or (d) any penalties or fines imposed on you or the Payment Processor by any bank, money services business, payment network, or other financial intermediary resulting from your use of the payment services in a manner not permitted by these Terms or any applicable rules and regulations (the “</span><b>Additional Contractor Amounts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). A Contractor is solely responsible for any Additional Contractor Amounts. Loom or the Payment Processor may, without prior notice, withhold any Additional Contractor Amounts</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from any amounts due to Contractor. Loom does not charge a fee when the Services Fees for any Services are to be paid exclusively as equity.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (c) </span><b>Opt-out Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you wish to avoid (i) having to pay the Loom Services Fees or (ii) working through the Loom payment and invoicing platform, you may pay Loom an opt-out fee of $3000 (as modified from time to time, the “</span><b>Opt-out</b> <b>Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). If you want to pay the Opt-out Fee, you shall notify Loom at support@loom.co The Opt-out Fee may be paid at any time but any Loom Services Fees paid or invoiced before the payment of the Opt-out Fee shall not be affected by the Opt-out Fee. The Opt-out Fee shall only apply to a specific Employer and a specific Contractor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even after the Opt-out Fee has paid, if an Employer hires that Contractor for a full-time position, the Employer must still pay the Placement Fee in accordance with Section 4.4 (d). </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(d)</span><b> Placement Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you wish to hire a Contractor that you met through the Loom Services for a full-time employment position, then you shall pay Loom a placement fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the Contractor’s aggregate first-year salary (as modified from time to time, the “</span><b>Placement Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). You shall notify Loom at </span><a href="mailto:support@loom.co"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@loom.co</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any such hire no later than ten (10) days after the Contractor has accepted your offer.
